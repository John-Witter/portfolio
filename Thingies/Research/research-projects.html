My research hovers around the intersection of environmental political theory (EPT), critical theory, contemporary political thought, environmental justice, and the environmental humanities. At the broadest level, my research focuses on developing a theory of ecopessimism to address the declining trust in governmental leadership, political stagnation, and ecological degradation that characterize this moment. Theorizing about pessimism is especially timely, as there are abundant reasons to feel negatively about politics—from inaction on climate change to increasing inequality and creeping authoritarianism.

Project 1: Theorizing Ecopessimism

In my dissertation, I argue that pessimism is a counterweight to American optimism and a compulsion to deny the political despair that has become ubiquitous in our age. While there are countless intractable structural problems, there is an equal abundance of politically unpalatable solutions. These are solutions that humanity has the technological capacity to entertain but not the political wherewithal to pursue. One explanation for this disconnect is that our contemporary moment shares an uneasy relationship with the narrative of history as progress, and the idea of history as Truth. There is an expectation—in the West—that the narrative arc of history bends toward progress. Even among the most aware, there is a near-pathological social compulsion to maintain optimism about the future—even when presented with mounting evidence that an increasingly chaotic future looms on the horizon. In my dissertation, I posit that pessimism, however disabused in popular culture, is a reasonable response to a bleak present that promises an uncertain future.

To lay the foundation for my argument and to build toward ecopessimism, my research explores the threads of pessimistic thought implicit in Friedrich Nietzsche, Michel Foucault, and the first generation of the Frankfurt School, but especially Theodor Adorno. Through the prism of Nietzsche and Foucault I illuminate what genealogical pessimism can offer for a theory of ecopessimism. Then, I look to Adorno for insights into a dialectical or critical pessimism. From there I turn to decolonial and afropessimist thinkers to examine the relationship between social death, liberation, settler colonialism, and environmental degradation. I round out my analysis by looking to contemporary theorists of affect who focus on hope, despair, optimism, and queer liberation—Sara Ahmed, Lauren Berlant, Jose Muñoz, Terry Eagleton, Joseph Winters, and Robyn Marasco, among others. I conclude by putting these thinkers in conversation with environmental political theory (EPT) to critique the problematic strains of previously existing ecopessimisms. I then weave together the aforementioned thinkers to develop a theory of left ecopessimism that avoids the pitfalls of ecoauthoritarianism, ecofascism, and the anti-human strains of eco-anarchism.

Project 2: Confronting the Racist History of American Environmentalism

In my second project, I explore the troubling legacies of John Muir and Edward Abbey, the putative darlings of the American West. Each of these men wrote gorgeous prose about the desert southwest and Rocky Mountains that inspired the development of the National Parks and an ethos of Western environmentalism—while simultaneously maintaining deplorable views about Indigenous people and immigrants. In this project, I build on the work of Prakash Kashwan (2020, forthcoming), Macarena Gómez-Barris (2017), Dorceta Taylor (2016), and Carolyn Merchant (2003) to unpack the troubled and racist legacy of the conservation and preservation movements in the U.S. and the Global South.

Project 3: Contextualizing the Theoretical Strands of EPT

My final upcoming project will address a deficit within EPT. There are currently two edited handbooks of EPT, and a newer volume that shows how the field addresses the dominant concepts of political theory. I propose to develop a manuscript that covers each of the theoretical strands of EPT. This will include chapters on romanticism, conservation, preservation, eco-authoritarianism, deep ecology, ecosocialism, ecofeminism, new materialism, civic republicanism, cosmopolitanism, environmental justice, indigenous/traditional ecological knowledge (TEK), ecopessimism, and radical ecotheory. I have laid much of the foundation for this project in my graduate training at Colorado State University, and once completed, it will be an excellent resource for environmental political theorists.
