            <h3>Overview</h3> 
              <p>My research draws on contemporary and critical theory to consider how we cope—politically, ethically, and personally—with environmental crisis, climate change, and environmental injustice. Central to my work is addressing anthropogenic environmental change through a critical interrogation of technocratic and undemocratic solutions to climate change and environmental disturbance. Forest fires, catastrophic floods, increased hurricanes, mega-droughts, and heat waves are all warning signs of what is to come with business-as-usual climate politics. Yet the political wherewithal to address climate change appears to be absent from the agenda. Climate change not only alters our ecological and political futures, it does so by distributing the consequences and suffering of climate change in a profoundly unjust manner. This is why, U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres refers to climate change as a “code red for humanity” while calling for the need to “defuse the [ticking] climate time-bomb.”  Climate change is the defining ecological and political crisis of our time, and it is at the heart of where political theory needs to focus its attention. This is why theorizing about the climate crisis and climate justice are at the core of my research.</p>

            <h3>Manuscript in Progress: <em>Ecopessimism: Theorizing for the Anthropocene</em></h3>
            <p>My manuscript draws on critical pessimism in the twentieth century to develop a novel theory of ecopessimism. Pessimism has long been disabused and misunderstood.  This confusion owes to a popular—rather than philosophical—conception of pessimism, which denudes pessimism of the critical resources vital to our political and ecological moment. Pessimism is an interpretive framework that offers novel insights about what it means to live, struggle, and be a political being during grim times. This is why it is uniquely poised to cope with anthropogenic climate change and ecological crisis. Climate change represents a breakdown in the narrative of progress, a historical understanding that implies a triumphant narrative arc blind to the persistence of injustice and inequality in the present. Ecopessimism, by contrast, is a ballast to this cruelly optimistic relationship to time.</p>

            <p>
              I have been the Instructor of Record for two online Summer sessions of History of Political Thought (a 400-level course), and a 100-level course with 90 students for non-majors, Current World Problems, which I taught as an Introduction to International Relations. Additionally, I have worked as a Graduate Teaching Assistant in myriad courses across sub-disciplines at Colorado State University and Northern Arizona University. I have delivered lectures and developed unique curriculum for many of my GTA courses. Spring of 2022 I was awarded GTA of the Year by the Political Science department for the curriculum development and lectures I delivered in Contemporary Political Theory. Beyond CSU, I delivered an invited lecture on Environmental Justice at Colorado College. Outside of my experience in the college classroom, I am nearly finished with a Graduate Teaching Certificate through Colorado State University's Institute for Learning and Teaching. Through my experiences I have begun to hone my craft and have had opportunity to experiment with pedagogical approaches to hone my craft as an instructor.
            </p>
            <p>
              On teaching evaluations, students regularly commend my instructional style, inclusive and supportive learning environment, course rigor, and the high-quality feedback I provide. In all of my courses I strive to develop a collaborative and inclusive learning environment, emphasize the intrinsic value of education while giving students instrumentally valuable skills, create space for conflict while maintaining compassion for difference, and motivate students to become active environmental and political agents, as well as stewards of their learning journey. Consequently, I design each of my courses to facilitate the success of students from divergent backgrounds, while expanding what they believe to be possible. Education has the capacity to be individually transformative, and, when the individual confronts the collective, education has the capacity to transform society.

              <li>“[The] classroom is pretty far from where I am living and my other classes which had me looking into switching classes before school started. The energy, environment, and subject matter that [she] presented in the first week immediately changed my mind and made me excited to be in this class for the semester!”</li>
              <li>“[Ms. Witlacil has] a really engaging teaching style, and it is never difficult to be engaged in class (from a fishery major, who has no interest in politics)!”</li>

              <li>“Professor Witlacil, given the focus of the course and the temporal nature of summer sessions, facilitated the course and its environment beyond initial expectations. Assigned reading, while occasionally overwhelming, provided great insight into the topic of the course, with the provision of extra credit allowing for students to make up for lost points resultant from such compact reading work.”</li>
              <li>“Witlacil worked with me extensively throughout this class as I struggled obtaining texts, understanding texts, and staying on course. She was very helpful and always encouraging I always felt very comfortable asking for help”</li>

              <li>“The readings were challenging, but absolutely worth doing. I sincerely felt I learned a lot from this course and now I feel less intimidated by reading theory. I feel I have the skills and knowledge to do it now and understand it.”</li>
              <li>“Professor Witlacil gave us an opportunity to set our own debate rules and that set up an inclusive environment in which every student felt safe and confident in making their argument.”</li>
