            <h3>Theorizing Ecopessimism</h3> 
              <p>In my dissertation, I argue that pessimism is a counterweight to American optimism and a compulsion to deny the political despair that has become ubiquitous in our age. While there are countless intractable structural problems, there is an equal abundance of politically unpalatable solutions. These are solutions that humanity has the technological capacity to entertain but not the political wherewithal to pursue. One explanation for this disconnect is that our contemporary moment shares an uneasy relationship with the narrative of history as progress, and the idea of history as Truth. There is an expectation—in the West—that the narrative arc of history bends toward progress. Even among the most aware, there is a near-pathological social compulsion to maintain optimism about the future—even when presented with mounting evidence that an increasingly chaotic future looms on the horizon. In my dissertation, I posit that pessimism, however disabused in popular culture, is a reasonable response to a bleak present that promises an uncertain future.</p>
              <p>To lay the foundation for my argument and to build toward ecopessimism, my research explores the threads of pessimistic thought implicit in Friedrich Nietzsche, Michel Foucault, and the first generation of the Frankfurt School, but especially Theodor Adorno. Through the prism of Nietzsche and Foucault I illuminate what genealogical pessimism can offer for a theory of ecopessimism. Then, I look to Adorno for insights into a dialectical or critical pessimism. From there I turn to decolonial and afropessimist thinkers to examine the relationship between social death, liberation, settler colonialism, and environmental degradation. I round out my analysis by looking to contemporary theorists of affect who focus on hope, despair, optimism, and queer liberation—Sara Ahmed, Lauren Berlant, Jose Muñoz, Terry Eagleton, Joseph Winters, and Robyn Marasco, among others. I conclude by putting these thinkers in conversation with environmental political theory (EPT) to critique the problematic strains of previously existing ecopessimisms. I then weave together the aforementioned thinkers to develop a theory of left ecopessimism that avoids the pitfalls of ecoauthoritarianism, ecofascism, and the anti-human strains of eco-anarchism.</p>

            <h3>Confronting the Racist History of American Environmentalism</h3>
            <p>In my second project, I explore the troubling legacies of John Muir and Edward Abbey, the putative darlings of the American West. Each of these men wrote gorgeous prose about the desert southwest and Rocky Mountains that inspired the development of the National Parks and an ethos of Western environmentalism—while simultaneously maintaining deplorable views about Indigenous people and immigrants. In this project, I build on the work of Prakash Kashwan (2020, forthcoming), Macarena Gómez-Barris (2017), Dorceta Taylor (2016), and Carolyn Merchant (2003) to unpack the troubled and racist legacy of the conservation and preservation movements in the U.S. and the Global South.</p>
          </div>
          <div id="project-3">
            <h3>Contextualizing the Theoretical Strands of EPT</h3>
            <p>My final upcoming project will address a deficit within EPT. There are currently two edited handbooks of EPT, and a newer volume that shows how the field addresses the dominant concepts of political theory. I propose to develop a manuscript that covers each of the theoretical strands of EPT. This will include chapters on romanticism, conservation, preservation, eco-authoritarianism, deep ecology, ecosocialism, ecofeminism, new materialism, civic republicanism, cosmopolitanism, environmental justice, indigenous/traditional ecological knowledge (TEK), ecopessimism, and radical ecotheory. I have laid much of the foundation for this project in my graduate training at Colorado State University, and once completed, it will be an excellent resource for environmental political theorists.</p>

            <p>
              I have been the Instructor of Record for two online Summer sessions of History of Political Thought (a 400-level course), and a 100-level course with 90 students for non-majors, Current World Problems, which I taught as an Introduction to International Relations. Additionally, I have worked as a Gradate Teaching Assistant in myriad courses across sub-disciplines at Colorado State University and Northern Arizona University. I have delivered lectures and developed unique curriculum for many of my GTA courses. Spring of 2022 I was awarded GTA of the Year by the Political Science department for the curriculum development and lectures I delivered in Contemporary Political Theory. Beyond CSU, I delivered an invited lecture on Environmental Justice at Colorado College. Outside of my experience in the college classroom, I am nearly finished with a Graduate Teaching Certificate through Colorado State University's Institute for Learning and Teaching. Through my experiences I have begun to hone my craft and have had opportunity to experiment with pedagogical approaches to hone my craft as an instructor.
            </p>
            <p>
              On teaching evaluations, students regularly commend my instructional style, inclusive and supportive learning environment, course rigor, and the high-quality feedback I provide. In all of my courses I strive to develop a collaborative and inclusive learning environment, emphasize the intrinsic value of education while giving students instrumentally valuable skills, create space for conflict while maintaining compassion for difference, and motivate students to become active environmental and political agents, as well as stewards of their learning journey. Consequently, I design each of my courses to facilitate the success of students from divergent backgrounds, while expanding what they believe to be possible. Education has the capacity to be individually transformative, and, when the individual confronts the collective, education has the capacity to transform society.

              <li>“[The] classroom is pretty far from where I am living and my other classes which had me looking into switching classes before school started. The energy, environment, and subject matter that [she] presented in the first week immediately changed my mind and made me excited to be in this class for the semester!”</li>
              <li>“[Ms. Witlacil has] a really engaging teaching style, and it is never difficult to be engaged in class (from a fishery major, who has no interest in politics)!”</li>

              <li>“Professor Witlacil, given the focus of the course and the temporal nature of summer sessions, facilitated the course and its environment beyond initial expectations. Assigned reading, while occasionally overwhelming, provided great insight into the topic of the course, with the provision of extra credit allowing for students to make up for lost points resultant from such compact reading work.”</li>
              <li>“Witlacil worked with me extensively throughout this class as I struggled obtaining texts, understanding texts, and staying on course. She was very helpful and always encouraging I always felt very comfortable asking for help”</li>

              <li>“The readings were challenging, but absolutely worth doing. I sincerely felt I learned a lot from this course and now I feel less intimidated by reading theory. I feel I have the skills and knowledge to do it now and understand it.”</li>
              <li>“Professor Witlacil gave us an opportunity to set our own debate rules and that set up an inclusive environment in which every student felt safe and confident in making their argument.”</li>
