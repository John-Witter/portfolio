          I am an Assistant Professor of Political Science at South Dakota School of Mines and Technology in the Department of
          Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences. I am an environmental political theorist with research interests in
          contemporary political thought, the first generation of the Frankfurt School of Critical Theory, Indigenous
          politics, and the eco-humanities. I have expertise in environmental justice, climate justice, the politics of
          climate change, as well as contemporary and historical political thought. My research considers how
          contemporary humans deal affectively, and politically with the climate crisis—an existential environmental
          problem that is the defining crisis of this generation. To that end, my first book project develops a theory
          of critical ecopessimism which unpacks the political, ethical, and affective resources offered by pessimism;
          and how these resources can help people better cope with and build solidarity in response to climate change
          and environmental injustice.
        </p>

          My work is published in New Political Science, <em>The Encyclopedia of Critical Political Science, Journal for

          anticipated Spring 2025 with Cornell University Press.

          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>My research draws on contemporary and critical theory to consider how we cope—politically, ethically, and
            personally—with environmental crisis, climate change, and environmental injustice. Central to my work is
            addressing anthropogenic environmental change through a critical interrogation of technocratic and
            undemocratic solutions to climate change and environmental disturbance. Forest fires, catastrophic floods,
            increased hurricanes, mega-droughts, and heat waves are all warning signs of what is to come with
            business-as-usual climate politics. Yet the political wherewithal to address climate change appears to be
            absent from the agenda. Climate change not only alters our ecological and political futures, it does so by
            distributing the consequences and suffering of climate change in a profoundly unjust manner. This is why,
            U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres refers to climate change as a “code red for humanity” while calling
            for the need to “defuse the [ticking] climate time-bomb.” Climate change is the defining ecological and
            political crisis of our time, and it is at the heart of where political theory needs to focus its attention.
            This is why theorizing about the climate crisis and climate justice are at the core of my research.</p>

          <h3>Manuscript in Progress: <em>Climate Pessimism</em></h3>
          <p>
            My manuscript draws on critical pessimism in the twentieth century to develop a novel theory of
            ecopessimism. Pessimism is an interpretive framework that offers novel insights about what it means to live,
            struggle, and be a political being during grim times. This is why it is uniquely poised to cope with
            anthropogenic climate change and ecological crisis. Faced with imminent, mutually reinforcing, political and
            ecological crises, pessimism may be the most promising ethos and affective framework for this historical
            moment. This is because climate change not only represents a global crisis, but also a breakdown in the
            narrative of progress. Simply put, we are not addressing global climate collapse in a way that aligns with
            narratives of progress, and if the climate crisis continues unabated it will undo much of what counts for
            so-called progress. Pessimism – when armed with joy – is a life-affirming ethic that provides resources to
            cope with and mobilize in response to this narrative breakdown. By accepting the possibility that things may
            get much worse, pessimism offers resilience and consolation for the dark moods that result from confronting
            the climate crisis. Finally, through discernment, pessimism provides resources for approaching the givenness
            of a particular political or conceptual formulation with caution, especially when faced with crises that
            disrupt certainty about the habitability of our planet.

          <h3>Teaching Philosophy</h3>
          <p>My pedagogical approach begins with the premise that personal experience is a starting point for knowledge,
            and I have just as much to learn from my students, as they do from me. To move beyond model of education
            where the teacher is viewed as the expert, I create opportunities for students to learn from each other,
            such as small group facilitation, peer-reviews, and mediated large group discussions.
          </p>
          <p>
            An education, especially in politics, gives students the opportunity to become intellectually well-rounded,
            politically engaged, and critically aware. Political science education gives students the tools to
            understand the world and our political landscape. Political theory, more specifically, teaches students how
            to think deeply and critically about political reality. Through classroom discussions of contentious
            concepts and topics, political theory teaches students how to discuss difficult topics with grace, and how
            to tolerate those with different viewpoints or values. I have students toggle between canonical texts and
            contemporary political theory to demonstrate how the resources provided by political theory can shed light
            on contemporary questions. By creating space for conceptual openness, and encouraging compassionate debate,
            I show students that disagreements, conflict, and openness are key elements of democratic engagement. This
            serves one of my main pedagogical goals, which is to give students the tools to become civically engaged.

          <h3>Politics of Nature and Technology (Fall 2024)</h3>
          <p>
            How do we make sense of the relationship between technology and nature when the politics of nature and
            technology are often at odds with one another? For environmentalists, technological innovation is a dual
            edged sword; it has the potential to solve environmental problems, but it can also cause widespread
            environmental damage. In this class you will learn several political approaches for thinking about the
            relationship between nature and technology including techno-optimism, ecological modernization, degrowth,
            eco-managerialism, eco-authoritarianism, ecofeminism, new materialism, and traditional ecological knowledge.
            Topics covered may include geo-engineering, critical minerals, artificial intelligence, the nascent space
            race, pollution, renewables, plastics, and the case for reparations.
          </p>

          <h3>Environmental Law and Policy (Spring 2023)</h3>
          <p>
            While the modern environmental movement began in the 1970s, the emergence of United States environmental law
            and policy began with the settling of North America. There appears to be broad agreement that the
            environment merits some political protection, but how to protect the environment is a source of heated
            political disagreement. In this class we will explore the history of US environmental law and policy from
            the founding to the present, with special emphasis on the colonial, conservation, progressive, and modern
            eras of environmental policy. After grasping the foundation of US environmental politics, we will pivot
            toward contemporary political battlegrounds to discuss the politics of climate change, energy
            use/consumption, and environmental justice.
          </p>

          <h3>Political Ideologies (Spring 2023)</h3>
          <p>
            Political ideologies permeate all aspects of contemporary existence. There is no escaping the effect they
            have on everything from domestic and international policy, social and political organization, and the
            experience of everyday life. In this course you will learn about various political ideologies and belief
            systems—from left to right, and everything in between. Political ideologies often emerge out of a specific
            historical context in response to what is perceived as a political problem or threat. How an ideology or
            adherents frame the political problem will have a strong effect on their proposed solution/s. Furthermore,
            how an ideology proposes to solve political problems will determine how proponents understand the role of
            the state; who is responsible for the problem, and who is the intended beneficiary of the solution; as well
            as the role of justice/the justice system, political change, and the economy. Beyond exposing you to
            ideologies across the political spectrum, this course will encourage you to critically examine your own
            political ideology and reflect on this in comparison with other ideologies. While the purpose of this course
            is not to change your mind, this course is an opportunity to think through your ideological commitments
            while experimenting with others. There may be no escape from ideological commitments, but they are subject
            to change.
