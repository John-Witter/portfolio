I have been the Instructor of Record for two online Summer sessions of History of Political Thought (a 400-level course), and a 100-level course with 90 students for non-majors, Current World Problems, which I taught as an Introduction to International Relations. Additionally, I have worked as a Gradate Teaching Assistant in myriad courses across sub-disciplines at Colorado State University and Northern Arizona University. I have delivered lectures and developed unique curriculum for many of my GTA courses. Spring of 2022 I was awarded GTA of the Year by the Political Science department for the curriculum development and lectures I delivered in Contemporary Political Theory. Beyond CSU, I delivered an invited lecture on Environmental Justice at Colorado College. Outside of my experience in the college classroom, I am nearly finished with a Graduate Teaching Certificate through Colorado State University's Institute for Learning and Teaching. Through my experiences I have begun to hone my craft and have had opportunity to experiment with pedagogical approaches to hone my craft as an instructor. 

On teaching evaluations, students regularly commend my instructional style, inclusive and supportive learning environment, course rigor, and the high-quality feedback I provide. In all of my courses I strive to develop a collaborative and inclusive learning environment, emphasize the intrinsic value of education while giving students instrumentally valuable skills, create space for conflict while maintaining compassion for difference, and motivate students to become active environmental and political agents, as well as stewards of their learning journey. Consequently, I design each of my courses to facilitate the success of students from divergent backgrounds, while expanding what they believe to be possible. Education has the capacity to be individually transformative, and, when the individual confronts the collective, education has the capacity to transform society.

Select Qualitative Student Evaluations

Current World Problems

•	“[Ms. Witlacil is] a super great teacher and always make us feel like if there's anything we need or are struggling with it wouldn't be a burden to come talk to [her]”
•	“[The] classroom is pretty far from where I am living and my other classes which had me looking into switching classes before school started. The energy, environment, and subject matter that [she] presented in the first week immediately changed my mind and made me excited to be in this class for the semester!” 
•	“[Ms. Witlacil has] a really engaging teaching style, and it is never difficult to be engaged in class (from a fishery major, who has no interest in politics)!”

History of Political Thought (Summer 2021)

•	“The support from the professor was nearly unmatched, she was always available to engage with and she kept a very nice balance of helping and challenging.”
•	“Professor Witlacil, given the focus of the course and the temporal nature of summer sessions, facilitated the course and its environment beyond initial expectations. Assigned reading, while occasionally overwhelming, provided great insight into the topic of the course, with the provision of extra credit allowing for students to make up for lost points resultant from such compact reading work.”
•	“Witlacil worked with me extensively throughout this class as I struggled obtaining texts, understanding texts, and staying on course. She was very helpful and always encouraging I always felt very comfortable asking for help”

History of Political Thought (Summer 2020)

•	“Professor Witlacil managed to get all of our grades back in time for us to review comments to improve. She was very flexible and willing to work with us so we could improve.” 
•	“The readings were challenging, but absolutely worth doing. I sincerely felt I learned a lot from this course and now I feel less intimidated by reading theory. I feel I have the skills and knowledge to do it now and understand it.”
•	“Professor Witlacil gave us an opportunity to set our own debate rules and that set up an inclusive environment in which every student felt safe and confident in making their argument.”
